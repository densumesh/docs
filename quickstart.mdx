## Create an account

To get started, sign up for a free account at [dashboard.trieve.ai](https://dashboard.trieve.ai). With a free account, you can upload up to 1000 chunks and 512 mb of files.

## Download the Trieve CLI

The Trieve CLI is a command line interface that helps you manage your Trieve account and projects. Install it globally with cargo. 

<Note>
  If you don't have cargo installed, you can download it [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).
</Note>

```bash
cargo install trieve
```

## Authenticate the CLI

To authenticate the CLI, you simply need to run the following command and follow the instructions:

```bash
trieve login
```

## Create a new dataset

### Using Trieve CLI

To create a new dataset, run the following command:

```bash
trieve dataset create
```

### Using [dashboard.trieve.ai](https://dashboard.trieve.ai)

Alternatively, you can also create a dataset at [dashboard.trieve.ai](https://dashboard.trieve.ai) by clicking on the "Create Dataset" button:

![create-dataset-on-dashboard](https://cdn.trieve.ai/docs/create-dataset-dashboard-button.png)

## Upload sample data

On the free tier you are able to create up to 1000 chunks and upload 512 mb worth of files.

### Using Trieve CLI

To upload a sample dataset, run the following command:

```bash
trieve dataset example
```

### Using Trieve API

Alternatively, you can also upload your own chunks using the Trieve API through a `POST` to the [/api/chunk route](/api-reference/chunk/create-or-upsert-chunk-or-chunks). 
See the [API reference for the create chunk(s) endpoint](/api-reference/chunk/create-or-upsert-chunk-or-chunks) to see all of the available options for adding things like `location`, `metadata`, or `timestamp` to your chunks.

#### 1. Copy a `dataset_id`

Get an `id` from the output of the `trieve dataset list` command or create a new dataset with the `trieve dataset create` command and copy the `id` from the output.

#### 2. Copy an `api-key`

Get an `api-key` from the result of the `trieve api-key generate` command making sure that it has both read and write permissions.

#### 3. POST to the `/api/chunk` endpoint

See the [API reference for the create chunk(s) endpoint](/api-reference/chunk/create-or-upsert-chunk-or-chunks) to see all of the available options for adding things like `location`, `metadata`, or `timestamp` to your chunks.

Below is a sample `curl` command to add a chunk to your dataset. Replace `<api-key>` with the API key you generated, and `<tr-dataset>` with the dataset ID you copied. 

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.trieve.ai/api/chunk \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'TR-Dataset: <tr-dataset>' \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "chunk_html": "Hello World",
  "tag_set": [
    "hello",
    "world"
  ],
}'
```

## Try search

### On [search.trieve.ai](https://search.trieve.ai)

You can try searching on the sample data you added by visiting [search.trieve.ai](https://search.trieve.ai) and entering a query in the search bar.

<Note>
  Make sure to select the dataset you uploaded the sample data to using the selector dropdown on the top left.
</Note>

![example-search-ui-query](https://cdn.trieve.ai/docs/example-search-ui-query.png)

### Using Trieve API

See the [API reference for the search endpoint](/api-reference/chunk/search) to see all of the available options for searching your dataset.

Below is a sample `curl` command to search your dataset. Replace `<api-key>` and `<tr-dataset>` with the API key and dataset ID you copied respectively.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.trieve.ai/api/chunk/search \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'TR-Dataset: <tr-dataset>' \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
    "query": "Hello World"
    "search_type": "hybrid"
  }'
```

## Try recommendations

### On [search.trieve.ai](https://search.trieve.ai)

1. Open a chunk by itself by clicking on the external link icon on the right side of the chunk.

![open-chunk-new-tab](https://cdn.trieve.ai/docs/open-chunk-new-tab.png)

2. Click on the "Get Related Chunks" button below the chunk.

![single-chunk-get-related-chunks-button](https://cdn.trieve.ai/docs/single-chunk-get-related-chunks-button.png)

3. The recommended chunks will be displayed below the button.

![single-chunk-related-chunks-result](https://cdn.trieve.ai/docs/single-chunk-related-chunks-result.png)

### Using Trieve API

See the [API reference for the recommend endpoint](/api-reference/chunk/get-recommended-chunks) to see all of the available options for getting recommendations for a specific chunk or chunks.

## Try RAG

<Tip>
  You can turn on [HyDE](https://medium.aiplanet.com/advanced-rag-improving-retrieval-using-hypothetical-document-embeddings-hyde-1421a8ec075a) for RAG in the settings for your dataset at [dashboard.trieve.ai](https://dashboard.trieve.ai).
</Tip>

Trieve makes it easy to put RAG into your application. You can try RAG in the following ways:

### On [chat.trieve.ai](https://chat.trieve.ai)

You can try RAG on the sample data you added by visiting [chat.trieve.ai](https://chat.trieve.ai) and entering a query in the chat box.

### Using Trieve API

#### One-off on specific chunks

Check the [API reference for the generate_from_chunks endpoint](/api-reference/chunk/rag-on-specified-chunk) to see details on how to perform LLM inference with a specific set of chunks in the context window.

![trieve-rag-example](https://cdn.trieve.ai/docs/trieve-rag-example.png)

#### RAG with stored conversation history

Memory managed RAG requires calling the following two routes in sequence:

1. [POST /api/topic](/api-reference/topic/create-topic) to create a topic with some `owner_id` where the conversation history will be stored. Commonly the `owner_id` is the user's ID or a fingerprint of the user's device. 
Make sure to store the returned `id` for the next step.
2. [POST /api/message](/api-reference/message/create-a-message) with the `topic_id` and some `new_message_content`. This will return a stream with some `N` chunks and LLM inference content separated by a `||` delimiter.
